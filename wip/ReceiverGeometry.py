# Receiver Point 
# Python 3.7.0 

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This is a module that converts all points of a given geometry file to 
receivers while maintaining their functionality as a building. For 
using singular points please refer to Receiver Point Source.

Will function as plane receiver and be a subclass of Geometry, but 
as that has not been integrated yet, this is here
