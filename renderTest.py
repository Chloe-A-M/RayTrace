#A,B,C are coordinates
# D is distance from (0,0,0) to plane, parallel to plane normal
# N  is the plane Normal
# v0 is the triangle's vertex
# 
# P = O + (t*R)
#
# D = N.dot(v0)     #########
#  
# P is point of intersection
# O is ray origin               veci in old code
# t is distance from O to P     dx in old code
# R is ray direction            F in old code
# 
# We are given O and R of the ray, also (a,b,c) and D. 
# P can be found with the known data
# We then find t using P,O, and R
# 
# t = - (N.dot(O) + D) / N.dot(R)   ###########
#
# We perform a check to see that t is less than the step length
# 
# ***Before t***
#   Compute N dot R 
#     if 0 then ray and plane are parallel
#     you would also be dividing by 0 
#
# if t < 0:
#   ray origin is behind the tri
#   no intersection
